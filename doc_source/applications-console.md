# Elastic Beanstalk application management console<a name="applications-console"></a>

You can use the AWS Elastic Beanstalk console to manage applications, application versions, and saved configurations\.

**To access the application management console**

1. Open the [Elastic Beanstalk console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk)\.

1. The console displays a list of all environments running in the current AWS Region, sorted by application\. Choose an application to view the management console for that application\.

**Note**  
If you have many applications, use the search bar in the upper\-right corner to filter the list of applications\.

   The **Environments** page shows an overview of all environments associated with the application\.

1. Choose an environment by name to go to the [environment management console](environments-console.md) for that environment to configure, monitor, or manage it\.

   Choose **Application Versions** to view a list of application versions for your application\.

   Here you can upload new versions, deploy an existing version to any of the application's environments, or delete old versions\. See [Managing application versions](applications-versions.md) for more information about the options on this page\.

1. Choose **Saved Configurations** to view a list of configurations saved from running environments\. A saved configuration is a collection of settings that you can use to restore an environment's settings to a previous state, or to create an environment with the same settings\.
