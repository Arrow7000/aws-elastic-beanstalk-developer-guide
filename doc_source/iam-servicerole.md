# Managing Elastic Beanstalk service roles<a name="iam-servicerole"></a>

To manage and monitor your environment, AWS Elastic Beanstalk performs actions on the environment's resources on your behalf\. Elastic Beanstalk needs certain permissions to perform these actions, and it assumes AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) service roles to get these permissions\.

Elastic Beanstalk needs to use temporary security credentials whenever it assumes a service role\. To get these credentials, Elastic Beanstalk sends a request to AWS Security Token Service \(AWS STS\) on a global endpoint\. For more information, see [Temporary Security Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

When you launch an environment in the Elastic Beanstalk console, the console creates a default service role, named `aws-elasticbeanstalk-service-role`, and attaches managed policies with default permissions to it\. 

Elastic Beanstalk provides a managed policy for [enhanced health monitoring](health-enhanced.md), and one with additional permissions required for [managed platform updates](environment-platform-update-managed.md)\. The console assigns both of these policies to the default service role\. The managed service role policies follow\.

**Managed service role policies**
+ **AWSElasticBeanstalkEnhancedHealth** – Grants permissions for Elastic Beanstalk to monitor instance and environment health\.

  ```

To allow Elastic Beanstalk to assume the `aws-elasticbeanstalk-service-role` role, the service role specifies Elastic Beanstalk as a trusted entity in the trust relationship policy\.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Sid": "",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
          "Service": "elasticbeanstalk.amazonaws.com"
        },
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
        "Condition": {
          "StringEquals": {
            "sts:ExternalId": "elasticbeanstalk"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
}
```

When you launch an environment using the [eb create](eb3-create.md) command of the Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Interface \(EB CLI\) and don't specify a service role through the `--service-role` option, Elastic Beanstalk creates the default service role `aws-elasticbeanstalk-service-role`\. If the default service role already exists, Elastic Beanstalk uses it for the new environment\.

If you use the `CreateEnvironment` action of the Elastic Beanstalk API to create an environment, specify a service role with the `ServiceRole` configuration option in the `aws:elasticbeanstalk:environment` namespace\. See [Using enhanced health reporting with the Elastic Beanstalk API](health-enhanced-api.md) for details on using enhanced health monitoring with the Elastic Beanstalk API\. 

When you create an environment by using the Elastic Beanstalk API, and don't specify a service role, Elastic Beanstalk creates a monitoring service\-linked role for your account, if it doesn't already exist, and uses it for the new environment\. A service\-linked role is a unique type of service role that is predefined by Elastic Beanstalk to include all the permissions that the service requires to call other AWS services on your behalf\. The service\-linked role is associated with your account\. Elastic Beanstalk creates it once, then reuses it when creating additional environments\. You can also use IAM to create your account's monitoring service\-linked role in advance\. When your account has a monitoring service\-linked role, you can use it to create an environment by using the Elastic Beanstalk API, the Elastic Beanstalk console, or the EB CLI\. For details about using service\-linked roles with Elastic Beanstalk environments, see [Using service\-linked roles for Elastic Beanstalk](using-service-linked-roles.md)\.

**Note**  
When Elastic Beanstalk tries to create the monitoring service\-linked role for your account when you create an environment, you must have the `iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole` permission\. If you don't have this permission, environment creation fails, and you see a message explaining the issue\.  
As an alternative, another user with permission to create service\-linked roles can use IAM to create the service linked\-role in advance\. You can then create your environment even without having the `iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole` permission\.

## Verifying the default service role's permissions<a name="iam-servicerole-verify"></a>

The permissions granted by your default service role can vary depending on when it was created, the last time you launched an environment, and which client you used\. You can verify the permissions granted by the default service role in the IAM console\.

**To verify the default service role's permissions**

1. Open the [**Roles** page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#roles) in the IAM console\.

1. Choose **aws\-elasticbeanstalk\-service\-role**\.

1. On the **Permissions** tab, review the list of policies attached to the role\.

1. To view the permissions that a policy grants, choose the policy\.

## Updating an out\-of\-date default service role<a name="iam-servicerole-update"></a>

If the default service role lacks the required permissions, you can update it by [creating a new environment](using-features.environments.md) in the Elastic Beanstalk environment management console\.

Alternatively, you can add the managed policies to the default service role manually\.

**To add managed policies to the default service role**

1. Open the [**Roles** page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#roles) in the IAM console\.

1. Choose **aws\-elasticbeanstalk\-service\-role**\.

1. On the **Permissions** tab, choose **Attach policies**\.

1. Type **AWSElasticBeanstalk** to filter the policies\.

1. Select the following policies, and then choose **Attach policy**:
   + `AWSElasticBeanstalkEnhancedHealth`
   + `AWSElasticBeanstalkService`

## Adding permissions to the default service role<a name="iam-servicerole-addperms"></a>

If your application includes configuration files that refer to AWS resources for which permissions aren't included in the default service role, Elastic Beanstalk might need additional permissions to resolve these references when it processes the configuration files during a managed update\. If permissions are missing, the update fails and Elastic Beanstalk returns a message indicating which permission it needs\. Add permissions for additional services to the default service role in the IAM console\.

**To add additional policies to the default service role**

1. Open the [**Roles** page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#roles) in the IAM console\.

1. Choose **aws\-elasticbeanstalk\-service\-role**\.

1. On the **Permissions** tab, choose **Attach policies**\.

1. Select the managed policy for the additional services that your application uses\. For example, `AmazonAPIGatewayAdministrator` or `AmazonElasticFileSystemFullAccess`\.

1. Choose **Attach policy**\.

## Creating a service role<a name="iam-servicerole-create"></a>

If you can't use the default service role, create a service role\.

**To create a service role**

1. Open the [**Roles** page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#roles) in the IAM console\.

1. Choose **Create role**\.

1. Under **AWS service**, choose **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**, and then select your use case\.

1. Choose **Next: Permissions**\.

1. Attach the `AWSElasticBeanstalkService` and `AWSElasticBeanstalkEnhancedHealth` managed policies and any additional policies that provide permissions that your application needs\.

1. Choose **Next: Tags**\.

1. \(Optional\) Add tags to the role\.

1. Choose **Next: Review**\.

1. Enter a name for the role\.

1. Choose **Create role**\.

You can apply your custom service role when you create an environment in the [environment creation wizard](environments-create-wizard.md) or with the `--service-role` option on the `[eb create](eb3-create.md)` command\.
